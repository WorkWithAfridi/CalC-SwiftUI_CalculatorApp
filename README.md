Getting Started
To get started with the Calculator app, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/WorkWithAfridi/SwiftUI-CalculatorApp.git
Open the project in Xcode.

Build and run the app on the iOS simulator or a physical device.

Usage
Once you have the app running, you can use it to perform basic calculations. The user interface consists of buttons for numbers, operators, and a display for the input and result.

Tap the number buttons to input numbers.
Tap the operator buttons to perform calculations.
Tap the equal (=) button to get the result.
Tap the clear (AC) button to reset the input and result.
Implementation Details
The Calculator app is implemented using SwiftUI, Apple's modern declarative UI framework. The UI is constructed using SwiftUI's view components, such as Text, Button, and VStack.

The calculation logic is implemented using Swift functions and operators. The input and result are stored in @State properties that trigger UI updates when their values change.
